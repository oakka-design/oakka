mission-statement: At the heart of Oakka Design is a belief that every room should
  be a reflection of your own individual style and personality. Why hire an interior
  designer, carpenter and project manager separately when you can have everything
  from Oakka Design? By bringing together the creative energy of an interior designer
  and the practical skills and precision of a carpenter/project manager, we are able
  to plan and create your perfect space. We would love to hear from you to discuss
  your project, whether it be a small room or complete refurbishment.
