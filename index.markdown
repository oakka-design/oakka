mission-statement: "At the heart of Oakka Design is a believe that every room should
  be a reflection of your own individual style and personality. \n\nBy bringing together
  the creative energy of an interior designer and the practical skills and precision
  of a carpenter/project manager all within our two person team, we are able to create,
  plan and realise your aspirations.\n\nWhy hire an interior designer, carpenter and
  project manager separately when you can have everything from Oakka Design.\n\nWe
  would love to talk to you about your project whether it be a small room or complete
  refurbishment. "
